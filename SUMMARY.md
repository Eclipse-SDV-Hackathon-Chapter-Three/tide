## 🎯 Your Questions Answered

### Q1: "Nav_app continuously prints ADAS events without mock running"

**Answer**: Other team members or retained messages on shared broker.

**Solutions** (in [TEAM_WORKFLOW.md](TEAM_WORKFLOW.md)):
- Use unique topic prefixes
- Clear retained messages
- Monitor broker to see who's publishing
- Coordinate with team

### Q2: "Vehicle status updates not publishing"

**Answer**: Vehicle simulator wasn't running.

**Solution**: Run `run_vehicle_simulator.py` - now created! ✅

### Q3: "MQTT broker on shared laptop with intranet"

**Answer**: Understood! ✅

**Adjustments Made**:
- Scripts assume broker at 192.168.41.250 is running
- Work offline when not on team WiFi
- Don't crash if connection fails
- Print events locally for visibility

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Terminals)

**Make sure you're on team WiFi!**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Vehicle telemetry
python run_vehicle_simulator.py

# Terminal 2: Navigation app
python -m nav_app.subscriber

# Terminal 3: Test scenarios
python run_mock_scenarios.py      # Full test (2 min)
# OR
python test_quick_scenarios.py    # Quick test (15 sec)
```

---

## 📊 Test Scenarios (10-second intervals)

1. 🚨 Police car ahead (200m)
2. 🚧 Traffic accident (50m - critical)
3. 🚶 Pedestrians crossing (80m)
4. 🏗️ Construction zone (300m)
5. 🚑 Emergency vehicle (behind)
6. 🚗🚙🚕 Traffic jam (150m, 5 cars)
7. 🚛 Broken down truck (120m)
8. 🚴 Cyclist on road (60m)
9. 🚌 Bus at stop (100m)
10. 🏍️ Motorcycle weaving (90-100m)
11. ⚠️ Multiple hazards (complex)
12. 🚪 Passenger exit event

## 📡 MQTT Topics

### Published by Simulators
```
vehicle/data                  - Vehicle telemetry (1 sec)
vehicle/adas-actor/seen       - ADAS hazard events
vehicle/passenger/left        - Passenger exit events
```

### Published by nav_app
```
infotainment/hazard           - Hazard notifications
infotainment/reroute          - Reroute suggestions
infotainment/alternatives     - Alternative transport
infotainment/status           - Vehicle status ⭐
infotainment/autonomous       - Autonomous mode
v2v/hazards/report            - Share hazards (V2V)
```

---

## 🔧 Connection States

### ✅ On Team WiFi
```
✅ Connected to broker at 192.168.41.250:1883
📡 Publishing to: vehicle/adas-actor/seen
```
**Result**: Full integration, events published to broker

### ⚠️ Offline
```
⚠️  Note: MQTT not connected - Connection refused
   (Make sure you're on team WiFi and broker at 192.168.41.250 is running)
   Messages are printed above for visibility.
```
**Result**: Scripts still work, events printed locally

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Print-First Design
All publishers **print events** before attempting MQTT:
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Always see what's being generated
- ✅ Debug-friendly

### 2. Graceful Degradation
Scripts handle MQTT failures gracefully:
- ✅ No crashes
- ✅ Helpful error messages
- ✅ Continue running locally

### 3. Shared Broker Aware
All documentation assumes:
- Broker at 192.168.41.250 (team laptop)
- Team WiFi required
- Multiple users may test simultaneously
- Coordination needed to avoid conflicts

### 4. Original Code Intact
- ✅ All new files, no modifications to SDV lab code
- ✅ Uses same contracts and topics
- ✅ Compatible with existing nav_app

## 📞 Quick Reference

```bash
# Start testing (3 terminals)
python run_vehicle_simulator.py      # Terminal 1
python -m nav_app.subscriber          # Terminal 2
python test_quick_scenarios.py        # Terminal 3

# Monitor MQTT traffic
mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.41.250 -t "#" -v

# Check what's being published
mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.41.250 -t "vehicle/#" -v

# Clear retained messages
mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.41.250 -t "vehicle/adas-actor/seen" -n -r
```

## 🙏 Notes

- All scripts work **offline** (print events locally)
- Full integration requires **team WiFi** connection
- Broker at **192.168.41.250:1883** assumed running
- Original SDV code **completely intact**
- 10-second intervals between scenarios **as requested**

**Happy Testing! 🚗💨**
