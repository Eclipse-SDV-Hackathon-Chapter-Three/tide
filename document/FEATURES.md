## Problem Statement

Drivers frequently encounter unexpected real-time events such as road maintenance, car accidents, traffic jams, and emergency situations that cause significant delays or bring traffic to a complete standstill. Currently, navigation services lack effective solutions for handling these situations, leaving drivers stuck with no alternative options.

## Solution Overview

We're building an intelligent vehicle system that detects real-time road events through onboard cameras, shares this information across a vehicle network, and provides affected drivers with alternative transportation options (public transit, taxi, walking). When a driver chooses an alternative method, the vehicle can autonomously navigate to the destination or return to a predefined location like home or a parking lot.

## Target Users

All vehicle owners and passengers who want to reach their destinations as quickly as possible while avoiding unexpected delays from real-time road events.

## Core Functionality

- **Event Detection & Sharing**: Recognize road events through camera analysis and share alerts with vehicles likely to use the same route
- **Smart Rerouting**: Dynamically select the fastest path by avoiding obstacles based on shared event data
- **Alternative Suggestions**: For drivers already affected by events, provide time-calculated alternatives including public transportation, taxi services, or walking options
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Calculate travel times using APIs from transportation services, taxi companies, and map providers
- **Autonomous Vehicle Handoff**: Enable the vehicle to continue to its destination autonomously after the driver exits, or return to a preset location

## Technology Stack

- Computer vision and AI for real-time event detection from camera feeds
- Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication network for data sharing
- Third-party APIs: public transportation schedules, ride-sharing services, mapping services
- Autonomous driving capabilities for vehicle self-navigation
- In-vehicle infotainment system integration

## Innovation/Uniqueness

Current navigation services treat real-time road events as unavoidable bad luck with no proactive solutions. Our approach uniquely combines AI-powered event detection, vehicle network sharing, multi-modal transportation integration, and autonomous driving to transform an unavoidable problem into a solvable one. Instead of simply rerouting, we provide comprehensive alternatives that may be faster than staying in the vehicle.

## Impact & Value

**For Individuals**: Eliminates the stress and time waste of being stuck in unexpected delays. Passengers gain flexibility to switch transportation modes mid-journey and still have their vehicle arrive at the destination.

**For Society**: Reduces traffic congestion by redistributing drivers to public transportation during peak delay events, creating better balance between private vehicles and public transit usage.

## Feasibility

The MVP is achievable within the hackathon timeframe by leveraging existing technologies: camera-based event detection (computer vision models), API integrations for transportation data, and simulated autonomous driving capabilities. We'll focus on demonstrating the core detection-sharing-suggestion workflow with a working prototype.

## Demo Plan

We'll showcase two parallel scenarios on the infotainment display:

1. **Affected Driver**: Shows real-time event detection, alternative transportation suggestions with calculated times, and the vehicle continuing autonomously after driver exit
2. **Approaching Driver**: Demonstrates receiving shared event data and dynamic path adjustment to avoid the affected area

Both scenarios will highlight the camera feed analysis, vehicle network communication, and decision-making interface.

## Future Potential

**For Automotive Industry**: Traditional car manufacturers can differentiate themselves by offering a feature that solves previously unavoidable problems, adding significant value to their vehicles.

**Scalability**: Expand to city-wide traffic management systems, integrate with smart city infrastructure, and contribute data to improve urban transportation planning.

**Social Impact**: Encourage more balanced usage between private vehicles and public transportation, reducing overall congestion and environmental impact.
